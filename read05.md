# Images

## Images are very important content element for each wesite in general, as one image better than 1000 words

### Images can be added through <img> element on html, and can be positioned and controlled via CSS

## Colors

# JPEG vs PNG vs GIF

## Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations.

## __Compression__

### Almost all medias we see on the web are compressed 

### Compression is mainly two types

### lossless compression, it is possible to reconstruct the original image from the compressed image because there is no information loss during compression

### lossy compression i.e. data loss in lossy compression is irreversible. Lossy compression algorithms always have a superior compression ratio (the ratio of size of compressed image to original image) as compared to lossless compression
