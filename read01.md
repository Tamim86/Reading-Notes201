# Website Structure
### Every web developer must have the following skills:
#### * HTML
#### * CSS
#### * JavaScript

## HTML
### HTML forms the site structure and controls the site content.
## Html structure:
#### * Head: contains meta data
#### * Body: and consists of the following
#### *   Header: Menus and navigation
#### *   Main: site content of paragraphs & images
#### *   Footer: Rights, site map, and other options

## Form Element
### The <form> element uses the action attribute to indicate the page that 
### the data is being sent to. Each of the form controls sits inside the <form>
### element. Different types of form control are suited to collecting different 
### types of data. The <fieldset> element is used to group related 
### questions together. The <label> element indicates the purpose of each 
### form control.
### 1- Whenever you want to collect information from 
### visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a 
### <form> element.
### 2- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
### 3- Each form control is given a name, and the text the 
### user types in or the values of the options they select 
### are sent to the server.
### 4- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it 
### easier for visitors to fill in forms
 
## Images
#### 1- You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. 
#### This is very helpful when you use the same sized 
#### images on several pages of your site.
#### 2-  Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically 
#### using CSS.
#### 3-  You can use a background image behind the box 
#### created by any element on a page. 
#### 4-  Background images can appear just once or be 
#### repeated across the background of the box.
#### 5- You can create image rollover effects by moving the 
#### background position of an image.
#### 6- To reduce the number of images your browser has to 
#### load, you can create image sprites

## HTML5 Layout
####  The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of 
#### different parts of a web page and help to describe 
#### its structure.
#### 2-  The new elements provide clearer code (compared 
#### with using multiple <div> elements).
#### 3- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 
#### elements need to be told which elements are 
#### block-level elements.
#### 4- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 
#### (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, 
#### which is available free from Google
