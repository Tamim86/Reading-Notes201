# Layout
### ### Control where each element sits on the web page

## Building blocks

### Block-level elements starts in new line

### Inline elements flow between surrounding text

### Containing elements when block=level element sits inside another block-level element the outer box is called Containing element

## Positions
### Position propeties controls how elements are positioned on the page
### The default position for all elements is Static
### position: relative => element can be replaced in relative to its origin place and will reserve the origional place after repositioning
### Position:absolute => act exactly as relative position except the element will not reserve it`s original position.
### Position: fixed => by using this position the element will keep scrolling allong the page
### Z-index => If you want to control which element sits on top, you can use the z-index property. Its value is a number, and the higher the number the closer that element is to the front. For example, an element with a z-index of 10 will apear over the top of one with a z-index of 5.
### Float => place boxes next to each othe.[float: left, float:right, float:both]

# Screen Size
## design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens  
## Screen resolution: Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens
## Page size => Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide 

## Fixed width layout
### Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.Measurements tend to be given in pixels

## Liquid layout => Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.
