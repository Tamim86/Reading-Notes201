# Problem Domain

## Problem Domain is the most important part to understand properly prior coding

## The more detailed and clear problem domain the easier coding and project execution

## In order to make problem domain easier to understand, you can devide it into parts

# Objects

## Objects group a set of variables and functions together in order to achieve something recognizable

### Variables inside objects called *properties*

### Functions inside objects called *Methods*

### var hotel = {
### name:'Veda'
### empoyees:80
### rooms:40
### function (){
###   code to execute;
###   }
### }

### The elements on the leftside (name,employees,rooms,function) are *Keys*, while the elements on the right side are values('Veda', 80, 40)


## Literal Notation is the easiest and most popular way to create Objects, just like the above hotel example

## Objects properties and methods can be accessed by '.' or '[]'
### var hotelName = hotel.name
### var hotelRooms = hotel['rooms']


# DOM [Document Object Model]
## basically DOM specifies how browser should create model of an HTML page and how J.S can access & update the content of the webpage on the browser.

### DOM is not part of HTML or J.S it is a separate set of rules implemented by browsers makers.
